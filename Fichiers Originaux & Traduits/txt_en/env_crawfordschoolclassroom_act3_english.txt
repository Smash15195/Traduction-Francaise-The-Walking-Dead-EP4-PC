2)  LEE
I don’t think so. I think we’re good, for now at least.
3)  LEE
[incredulous] What? How the fuck is this good?
4)  MOLLY
Same thing that always happens, I guess. In the end, the dead always win.
5)  CHRISTA
No. You wanna do a headcount? Or do you want to get what we need and get the hell out of here?
6)  BEN
I got a bad feeling about this.
7)  CHRISTA
What the hell happened here? I thought this place was supposed to be secure!
8)  VERNON
No, this is good.
9)  KENNY
Fuck. Fuck! Do you think they saw us?
110)  KENNY
Fuck. Fuck! Do you think they saw us?
10)  BEN
The plan hasn’t changed? Every time walkers show up the plan changes! Do you even have any idea how many of them are out there?
11)  BEN
Oh man, we are screwed, we are so screwed...
12)  KENNY
I agree. So long as we don’t let ‘em box us in, we can still do this. The plan hasn’t changed.
13)  BRIE
Come on, I think I know which way to head.
14)  MOLLY
Just keep moving.
15)  LEE
Looks okay. Everybody in.
16)  BRIE
Here.
17)  CHRISTA
{angrya}[impatient]What about the medicine?
146)  CHRISTA
{angrya}[impatient]What about the medicine?
18)  CHRISTA
{normala}	I’ll go for the medicine.
19)  KENNY
{angrya}No, two people’s enough. You stay here, see if you can use any of those tools we brought to get that armory door open. {normalb}We might need to shoot our way out of here.
20)  MOLLY
{angrya}Okay, so now what? Where do we start looking?
21)  BRIE
{normala}Here.
22)  LEE
{disgusta}Figures.
23)  BEN
{happya}	I’ll come too.
24)  LEE
{normalc}Okay, we’ve got a plan. Everyone be careful, stay close to one another, we’ll all meet back here. {normala}Good luck.
25)  KENNY
{thinkinga}Looks like they were using this room as some kind of command center.
26)  MOLLY
{feara}[caught off-guard] Just makes sense, doesn’t it?
27)  CHRISTA
{disgusta}How do you know that?
28)  BRIE
{normala}There’s a maintenance shed across from the playground here, if they were storing fuel that’s probably where it’ll be.
29)  MOLLY
{normala}Right here. Nurse’s station, they were using it as a medical facility.
30)  KENNY
{angrya}Okay, I’ll make the run to the maintenance shed for the fuel.
31)  BRIE
{normala}Yup, it’s called Herman’s you can’t miss it.
32)  LEE
{thinkinga}So then we just need a battery. [pointing at the map] {normala}This auto shop, it’s right next door?
33)  VERNON
I’ll come with you, I know what to take.
34)  BRIE
{normala}	It’ll be faster if l go with you, I can take you right to it.
35)  MOLLY
{normalA}I’ll go with you, watch your back.
36)  CLEMENTINE
{thinkinga}Can’t I come with you?
37)  CLEMENTINE
{sadb}Okay.
38)  LEE
{happya}You don’t want to leave Ben here on his own, do you? He’s going to be working on that door so he needs someone to watch his back. {normala}That’s you.
39)  LEE
{Happya}I need you to stay here with Ben and watch over our command center.  {normala}I’m putting you in charge of it. Okay?
40)  CLEMENTINE
{happya}What about me, what can I do?
41)  LEE
{feara}So I want you to take this.
42)  LEE
{happya}It’s okay, take it.
43)  LEE
{normala}You remember how to use it, don’t you? It’s just like I showed you.
44)  CLEMENTINE
{feara}	I remember.
45)  LEE
{angrya}So if anyone tries to come inside this room that isn’t one of us...
46)  CLEMENTINE
{disgusta}I know.
47)  LEE
{happya}Hey. Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be okay.
48)  LEE
{happya}Back before you know it.
49)  LEE
{normala}[lookat]Looks like they had quite a system here. Crawford’s Final Solution.
50)  LEE
{normala}[lookat]So according to Brie, fuel is at the maintenance shed, medicine might be at the nurse's office, and a battery would probably be at the auto shop out through here.
51)  CLEMENTINE
{happyc}	You’re back!
73)  CLEMENTINE
{happyc}	You’re back!

54)  LEE
{happya}	Sure did. Molly has it.
76)  LEE
{happya}	Sure did. Molly has it.
55)  CLEMENTINE
{happyb}	Cool! {normala}[concerned] Where is she?
77)  CLEMENTINE
{happyb}	Cool! {normala}[concerned] Where is she?
56)  LEE
{happya}She’s fine, she’ll be back real soon.
78)  LEE

87)  BEN
{thinkinga}[looking behind Lee, confused] And... where’s Molly?
67)  LEE
{disgusta}She headed off on her own to do some damn thing. Girl’s stone-cold crazy. {thinkingb}She said she’d be back. How’s that door coming?

106)  KENNY
{happya}We got the fuel.
107)  LEE
{thinkinga}Any word from Christa and Vernon?
108)  BEN
{sade}Nothing. They must still be at the nurse's office.
109)  LEE
Then maybe I'd better go check in.
111)  
I don't think so.
112)  
Definitely
115)  
Definitely
113)  LEE

[irritated]I'll take that as a "yes" then?
122)  
How is this good?
123)  
He's right.
124)  LEE
Vernon's right. Walkers we can deal with easier than armed guards.
125)  
We should leave. Now.
126)  LEE
It's all over. We should leave this place. Now.
127)  VERNON
No, listen to me.
130)  BEN
[nervous]Did he just say this is a good thing?
135)  BEN
[nervous]Did he just say this is a good thing?
132)  VERNON
Look at it this way...
134)  VERNON
Look at it this way...
136)  
Fuel?
137)  BRIE
{thinkinga}[examining the map] Just give me a sec...
138)  LEE
{thinkinga}Where can we find some fuel for the boat?
139)  
Medicine?
140)  
Battery?
141)  LEE
{thinkinga}Where would be the best place to look for medicine?
142)  VERNON
[pickup]{normala}	[pointing to the map]Maybe at the auto shop? There used to be one in the alley outside the fire escape.

144)  KENNY
[pickup]{angrya}[impatient] So what about a battery?
145)  KENNY
{angrya}[impatient]What about the fuel? Where should I start looking?
147)  KENNY
{angrya}[impatient]What about the fuel? Where should I start looking?
148)  LEE

[pickup]The Georgia state flag. A lot of history there... not that it matters much now, I guess.
155)  LEE
[pickup]Might come back for these later. Any reading material would be nice once we get on that boat.
156)  LEE
[pickup]Creepy.
157)  LEE
[pickup]No power, no TV.
158)  LEE
[pickup]Just a bunch of paste.

172)  CLEMENTINE
[pickup][with a wink, hushed]Oh. Okay.
173)  LEE
[pickup][to himself]Some kind of indoctrination pamphlet. These people had their shit well organized... until it all went to hell.
175)  LEE
[pickup][to himself]Brie said the entrance to the auto shop was in the alleyway by this fire escape.
176)  LEE
[pickup][to himself]The fuel's in a shed across from the playground. It's just outside the stairwell.
177)  LEE
[pickup][to himself]If we're going to find medicine anywhere, that would be the place to look.
