2)  KENNY
{Body-a}{AngryA}Lady, I {AngryB}ain’t the one who’s bleeding.
3)  LEE
{Body-B}{AngryA}Just get us inside, {AngryB}I don't care how you do it!
4)  KENNY
[irritated at Lee]{Body-A}{AngryB}Maybe you should come up with some ideas, then.
5)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{SadA}Shit, that’s gonna get infected. {SadB}We’ve got to get him inside, clean him up.
6)  LEE
{SadA}Kenny? {ThinkingA}How's that door coming?
7)  LEE
{Body-B}{FearB}You okay?
8)  OMID
[still hurting] {Body-A}{SadB}Ugh... yeah.
9)  LEE
[strenuous effort] Uuuurgh!
10)  OMID

11)  OMID
[in agony] {Body-A}{AngryC}Gaaaaaaah!
12)  CHRISTA
Come on, baby!
13)  OMID
I can’t! It’s caught on my damn leg! Aaaaaargh, shit!
14)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}You're not all right. {WorriedA}You've re-opened your wound, you're losing blood and {AngryA}God only knows what might've gotten in there. {worriedA}It could be infected, it could be-
15)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}How’s he looking?
16)  OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}I’m all right.
17)  OMID
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}No offense but you {HappyA}really need to work on your bedside manner.
18)  
It probably looks worse than it is.
19)  
She’s right, it looks bad.
20)  
We’ll take care of it.
21)  CHRISTA
{HappyA}Thanks.
22)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}Just get us inside the house, will you?
23)  OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}Except when it’s a bite.
24)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Try not to worry, {HappyA}it always looks worse than it really is.
25)  LEE
{sadA}Yeah, {ThinkingA}well it’s not a bite. {HappyA}We’re gonna get you fixed up.
26)  CHRISTA
{ThinkingA}Lee.
27)  LEE
{NormalC}I’m on it.
28)  LEE
Yeah?
29)  LEE
[smiles] {HappyA}No problem.
30)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{AngryA}Please, we {WorriedA}have to get him inside.
31)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}Christa’s right, {SadA}it looks pretty bad.
32)  LEE
{AngryA}Quit trying to be a tough guy, Omid. {FearA}Hell, I’d be crying like a baby, {NormalD}my leg looked like that.
33)  OMID
{Body-A}{HappyA}You’re as bad as she is! {ThinkingA}I’m telling you, it’s just a- [sudden pain] {PainA}Aaaargh! Jesus!
34)  LEE
{NormalC}Don’t worry, {ThinkingA}I’m on it.
35)  LEE
I’m on it, just sit tight.
36)  OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}Okay. {HappyA}Thanks, man.
37)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalD}She’s just worried about you, man. {ThinkingA}Don’t worry, we’re gonna get you fixed up in no time, {HappyA}just as soon as we’re inside. Okay?
38)  CHRISTA
[pickup2]{Body-A}{WorriedA}Please go and help Kenny. {AngryA}We need to get him inside NOW!
39)  OMID
Hey, I’m not going anywhere.
40)  CHRISTA
[pickup2]{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Lee, will you please see what’s happening with getting us inside? {AngryB}We can’t stay out here like this!
41)  OMID
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}Okay, you’re not exactly filling me {PainA}with confidence here.
42)  LEE
Hey Clem, come away from the gate, okay? It’s not safe.
43)  CLEMENTINE
[anxious] {Body-HandOnWrist}{FearA}Do you think the dead people saw us come back here? {FearB}Are they going to find us?
44)  
No, they didn’t see us.
45)  
I think they did.
46)  
Try not to worry.
47)  
Wait
49)  LEE
{Body-F}{HappyA}No, they didn’t see us. {NormalB}We were too fast for them.
50)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{FearB}I can still hear them out there. {Body-HandsOpen}{FearC}It sounds like they’re getting closer.
51)  LEE
{ThinkingA}It’s just your imagination.
52)  CLEMENTINE
{SadA}I’ll feel safer when we’re inside the house.
53)  LEE
{Body-F}{SadA}Yeah, {FearA}I think maybe they did.
54)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{FearA}I think so too. {Body-HandsOpen}{ThinkingB}I'm standing guard in case they show up.
55)  LEE
{HappyA}You don’t need to do that, {NormalC}we’re going to be safe inside real soon. {ThinkingA}Until then, {HappyA}just stay close to me okay?
56)  CLEMENTINE
{HappyA}Okay.
57)  LEE
{Body-F}{ThinkingA}Try not to worry. Even if they saw us, {NormalC}they can’t get in here.
58)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{ThinkingA}We did. {ThinkingB}Why can’t they?
59)  LEE
{HappyA}We’re a lot smarter than they are. {ThinkingA}They’re just like dumb animals, {ThinkingB}they can’t open doors.
60)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandsOpen}{NormalC}I used to have a pet hamster. {ThinkingB}One night he figured out how to open the door to his cage, {NormalB}and when we woke up he’d eaten half a box of cookies.
61)  LEE
{HappyA}I don’t think this is quite the same, Clem.
62)  CLEMENTINE
{ThinkingA}Yeah, right. {ThinkingB}This time, {FearB}we’re the cookies.
63)  LEE
Just stay {ThinkingA}away from the gate. {NormalC}I’m gonna see about getting us inside the house.
64)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{FearB}I guess that’s a {Body-HandsOpen}yes.
65)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}How’s it coming? {ThinkingA}We find a way in yet?
66)  KENNY
{Body-A}{NormalC}Nah, we’d have heard from ‘em by now, {NormalB}all the racket we’re making. {DisgustA}But whoever was here did a pretty good job fortifying it. {HappyA}Nice place to hole up... {ThinkingA}if we can just figure out how to get in.
67)  KENNY
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}All these windows are boarded up good, {AngryA}we ain’t getting in that way.
68)  BEN
{Body-A}{ThinkingB}Door’s locked, too. {AngryA}Too heavy to force it.
69)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingB}You think maybe someone’s still inside?
70)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingB}What’s this? {ThinkingA}Looks like there’s some kind of pet door here.
296)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingB}What’s this? {ThinkingA}Looks like there’s some kind of pet door here.
71)  KENNY
[accusatory, to Ben] {Body-A}{DisgustA}How the hell did you miss that?
294)  KENNY
[accusatory, to Ben] {Body-A}{DisgustA}How the hell did you miss that?
72)  BEN
{Body-A} {ThinkingA}I tried it already, that’s locked too.
297)  BEN
{Body-A} {ThinkingA}I tried it already, that’s locked too.
73)  KENNY
{AngryA}Who the hell ever heard of a locked doggie door?
295)  KENNY
{AngryA}Who the hell ever heard of a locked doggie door?
74)  OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}I have. {ThinkingA}My neighbor had one just like that. It’s radio-controlled, {NormalB}the dog wears a collar with a chip in it so the door only opens when the dog gets close to it.
293)  OMID
{Body-A}{PainA}I have. {ThinkingA}My neighbor had one just like that. It’s radio-controlled, {NormalB}the dog wears a collar with a chip in it so the door only opens when the dog gets close to it.
75)  KENNY
{DisgustA}Well, shit. {AngryA}Every day’s a school day.
292)  KENNY
{DisgustA}Well, shit. {AngryA}Every day’s a school day.
76)  BEN
{NormalB}All right, {NormalC}so... {ThinkingA}where’s the dog?
77)  LEE
All we need is the collar...
78)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}Empty. {ThinkingA}Yeah, that would {HappyA}have been too easy.
79)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}It's empty.
80)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}A shovel is never not useful.
81)  LEE
{Body-B}{DisgustA}Looks like something was buried here.
82)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{FearB}Are you okay?
83)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{WorriedA}I said I’m fine, okay?
84)  LEE
[disgusted]{DisgustB} Aaaagh! Jesus!
85)  BEN
[turning away] {Body-A}{FearB}Okay, that is NOT cool.
86)  CHRISTA
{Body-A}{SadB}I’m fine, honey.{DisgustA} It’s just the smell.
87)  OMID
{Body-A}{FearB}Are you sure you-
88)  OMID
{Body-A}{FearA}Hey, be careful. Digging up {ThinkingA}dead things isn’t what it used to be, {FearA}know what I mean?
286)  OMID
{Body-A}{FearA}Hey, be careful. Digging up {ThinkingA}dead things isn’t what it used to be, {FearA}know what I mean?
89)  LEE
Just do what I {SadA}say, okay?
90)  BEN
{Body-A}{DisgustA}Oh God, the smell.
91)  LEE
{Body-B}{FearA}Yeah, I hear you.
287)  LEE
{Body-B}{FearA}Yeah, I hear you.
92)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{FearA}What’s buried down there?
285)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{FearA}What’s buried down there?
93)  LEE
{Body-B}{NormalC}Nothing. Clem, {ThinkingA}go over and sit with Christa and Omid, {HappyA}okay?
94)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{ThinkingA}But I want to-
95)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Looks like the collar’s still on it.
96)  LEE
{DisgustA}Ugh... I can’t get it off.
97)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}No way I'm gonna be able to bust through that.
98)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{HappyC}Ta-da!
99)  BEN
{FearB}Be careful, man...
100)  CHRISTA
[urgently/worried] {Body-A}{WorriedA}Whatever you’re going to do, do it fast...
101)  LEE
{AngryA}Okay, lemme see if I can reach up in there...
102)  LEE
[straining] {AngryC}Uugh... it’s no good, {ThinkingA}I can’t get it.
103)  BEN
{AngryA}Here, let me try. {ThinkingA}I think I can-
104)  LEE
[beside himself] {Body-B}{FearC}Clem! {AngryC}Goddammit, get back here! {FearD}Clementine!
105)  BEN
{Body-A}{ThinkingA}You see anything in there?
106)  LEE
{Body-B}{normalB}No. {ThinkingA}Looks like it’s been empty a while.
107)  LEE
{Body-B}{ThinkingA}Here goes nothing...
108)  KENNY
[jubilant] {Body-A}{HappyB}Yes! {HappyC}Goddamn!
109)  
Don’t ever do that again!
110)  
Good job, Clem!
111)  
You should have asked me first.
112)  LEE
{AngryB}That’s not the point, that was dangerous and stupid! {FearB}You don’t know what might be in there!
113)  LEE
[angry] {Body-B}{AngryC}Don’t ever do {FearB}that again!
114)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-Stand}{SadC}I was only trying to help!
115)  CHRISTA
{body-A}{AngryB}Little harsh on her, don’t you think?
116)  OMID
{Body-A}{FearB}Can we maybe have this conversation inside? {PainA}My leg’s starting to hurt like hell.
126)  OMID
{Body-A}{FearB}Can we maybe have this conversation inside? {PainA}My leg’s starting to hurt like hell.

121)  LEE
{HappyB}Yes you did. {HappyA}You did good.
122)  LEE
{Body-B}{HappyA}Good work, Clem. {ThinkingA}But don’t go shooting off like that without asking first, okay?
123)  CLEMENTINE
{Body-HandOnWrist}{SadB}I was just trying to help.
124)  LEE
{SadA}I know. {HappyA}And you did good. {NormalD}You just had me worried there for a minute.

[pickup][hushed]{Body-A}{SadA}I don't know. {FearA}It's... {ThinkingA}it's like all he can think about is finding a boat. {NormalB}He definitely doesn't want to talk about Katjaa and Duck. {SadA}At least not with me.
