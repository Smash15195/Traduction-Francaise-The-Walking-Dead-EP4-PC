1)  VERNON
[calm/non-confrontational] {thinkingA}Who are you?
2)  
I don’t want any trouble.
3)  
I could ask you the same.
4)  
Nobody.
7)  LEE
{fearA}I don’t want any trouble.
8)  VERNON
[pickup][nervous, voice trembling slightly]Neither do we. {disgustA}Which is why you’d do well to turn around and leave. R-right now.
9)  LEE
{angryA}I could ask you the same question.
10)  VERNON
[pickup][nervous, voice a little shakey]{angryA}You barged in on us. {surprisedA}And I’m the one holding the gun. {angryA}So I’ll ask you again. {disgustA}Who are you?
11)  LEE
{thinkingA}Nobody. I’m just lost, {sadA}trying to get back home.
12)  VERNON
[pickup][nervous]{thinkingA}Yeah, well, you took a wrong turn. {angryA}This is our home, not yours. And you’re not welcome here.
13)  VERNON
[more agitated, nervous] {disgustA}I said who are you?
14)  VERNON
[more agitated, nervous] {disgustA}I said who are you?
15)  LEE
{thinkingA}Look, I’m sorry I disturbed you folks.{surpriseA} I’ll just be going.
16)  BRIE
{angryC}You can’t let him leave.{angryD} He’s from Crawford! If he goes back there and they find out we’re down here...
17)  VERNON
[pickup][nervous, voice tremivling]{disgustA}Are you from Crawford? D-don’t lie to me, I’ll know.
18)  LEE
{sadA}No. I’m not any part of that, I swear.
19)  BRIE
{angryD}Bullshit!
20)  LEE
{thinkingA}I’m not from around here. {normalB}I’m from Athens, grew up in Macon.
21)  VERNON
[softening/concerned] {happyA}I have a brother in Macon. {fearB}You were there? How was it? As bad as here?
22)  LEE
[grim] {sadB}I’m sorry.
23)  BRIE
[still highly suspicious] {angryC}You can’t trust him, Vernon. {angryD}You can’t let him leave.
24)  VERNON
[pickup][nervous, shakey] {fearD}W-what do you want me to do, shoot him in the head?
25)  BRIE
{angryB}Why not? {angryC}That’d be more of a mercy than anyone from Crawford ever showed us. {fearC}Think, Vernon! What do you think they’ll do if they find out we’re down here, right under their feet?
26)  VERNON
[a grim resolve] {angryA}Dammit, you’re right. {sadB}I’m sorry, friend. Can’t take the risk.
27)  
Let's talk about this.
29)  
Let's talk about this.
28)  
[Threaten him]
31)  LEE
{normalD}Look. You don’t want to do this. {fearC}Let’s talk, okay?
32)  VERNON
[pickup][nervous]{angryA}What’s to talk about? {angryB}You won’t even tell us who you are.
33)  LEE
{fearA}My name’s Lee. I’m a history professor. And I don’t want to die today. {thinkingA}And I don’t think you want to kill me either.
34)  VERNON
[pickup][nervous]{fearD}Don’t! Don’t come any closer {disgustA}or I’ll shoot!
35)  LEE
[calm/negotiating] {happyB}Come on, let's just talk about this.
36)  BRIE
[increasingly agitated] {fearC}Vernon, what are you doing? Shoot him!
37)  LEE
{fearA}Nobody needs to get shot. Just take it easy.
38)  LEE
[totally genuine] There’s a little girl up there who’s relying on me. Her name’s Clementine. She’s eight years old. I’m all she’s got. If I don’t make it back... [too painful to contemplate] You kill me, you kill her too.
39)  BRIE
[panicking] Don’t listen to him, he’s messing with you! Shoot him!!
40)  LEE
{fearA}It’s all right. It’s okay.
41)  BRIE
{fearC}Vernon, what the hell are you doing?!
42)  BRIE
{angryD}Vernon!
43)  LEE
Relax. I told you I don’t want any trouble.
134)  LEE
Relax. I told you I don’t want any trouble.
44)  LEE
{thinkingA}Relax. I’m not here to hurt you.
45)  LEE
{surpriseA}You threatening me, old man? {angryB}Because you’re not gonna like how that goes. {angryC}Put the fucking gun down before you really make me mad.
46)  BRIE
{fearA}He’s bluffing.
47)  LEE
{angryC}You think so? Try me.
48)  LEE
[voice rising, threatening] I’ve got a little girl back there who’s depending on me. If you think I won’t do anything to get back to her, just try me.
49)  VERNON
[nervous/afraid] {angryB}Keep back or I swear I’ll shoot!
139)  VERNON
[nervous/afraid] {angryB}Keep back or I swear I’ll shoot!
140)  VERNON
[nervous/afraid] {angryB}Keep back or I swear I’ll shoot!
50)  LEE
{thinkingB}No. I don’t think so. I know killers, I’ve seen my share. {angryA}You ain’t got the look. {angryB}And that means you ain’t got the balls. [barking] {angryD}Now drop the goddamn gun!
51)  BRIE
{fearC}My God. Vernon, what have you done?
52)  LEE
You did the right thing.
53)  LEE
Okay now.
54)  BRIE
{fearC}I told you, he’s lying! He’s one of them! {angryD}Kill him before he kills us!
55)  LEE
Who are you people?
56)  VERNON
[pickup][still a little nervious]{fearB}You’re really not from Crawford?
57)  LEE
{normalD}No. I’m really not.
58)  VERNON
[pickup][reluctantly] {fearA}Well... we are. Or were. {fearB}We got out of there when they started sealing up the place, {disgustA}started weeding out the sick and the old so their perfect survivor society wouldn’t be threatened. {angryA}No room for weakness or vulnerability in their little master race.
59)  LEE
{thinkingA}You don’t look that old. So... you’re sick?
196)  LEE
{thinkingA}You don’t look that old. So... you’re sick?
60)  BRIE
Were sick. We’re all members of a cancer survivors group that used to meet here at the hospital.
187)  VERNON
Were sick. We’re all members of a cancer survivors group that used to meet here at the hospital.
61)  VERNON
{thinkingA}We’re in remission. But that wasn’t good enough for Crawford. {normalA}They’d already rounded up five of us before the rest of us managed to hole up and hide from them down here. This old basement’s been abandoned for years.
62)  LEE
{thinkingA}What is this, a morgue?
200)  LEE
{thinkingA}What is this, a morgue?
63)  VERNON
{thinkingA}Yeah. Irony’s always high on my list when I’m looking for a place to survive. How did you find your way down here?
64)  LEE
{normalD}A few of us got boxed in by walkers up on the street, I came down here trying to get away. {sadA}Now I just want to get out of here and get back to my own people.
65)  VERNON
{happyA}That sewer system you came through runs all over the city, {happyB}it’ll take you wherever you want to go.
146)  VERNON
{happyA}That sewer system you came through runs all over the city, {happyB}it’ll take you wherever you want to go.
149)  VERNON
{happyA}That sewer system you came through runs all over the city, {happyB}it’ll take you wherever you want to go.
160)  VERNON
{happyA}That sewer system you came through runs all over the city, {happyB}it’ll take you wherever you want to go.
66)  
I’ll be fine on my own.
67)  
Can you show me the way back?
68)  BOYD
Vern, you’re not just going to let him go back out there alone, are you? Those sewers are like a maze, he’s got no chance of finding his way back without a guide.
212)  BOYD
Vern, you’re not just going to let him go back out there alone, are you? Those sewers are like a maze, he’s got no chance of finding his way back without a guide.
69)  BRIE
He found his way here easily enough, didn’t he?
70)  LEE
I wouldn’t exactly call it easy. You know, maybe I could use a little help.
71)  VERNON
{sadB}Look, I’d like to help you. But we’ve all got our own problems. Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I’m the only doctor here.
162)  VERNON
{sadB}Look, I’d like to help you. But we’ve all got our own problems. Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I’m the only doctor here.
72)  BRIE
{angryC}Besides, why should we help you?
161)  BRIE
{angryC}Besides, why should we help you?
204)  BRIE
{angryC}Besides, why should we help you?
213)  BRIE
{angryC}Besides, why should we help you?
73)  LEE
{thinkingB}Those sewers are like a damn maze. Any chance you could help me find my way back?
74)  VERNON
Look, I’d like to help you. But we’ve all got our own problems. Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I’m the only doctor here.
75)  BRIE
Besides, why should we help you?
76)  
If you don’t, I’ll kill you.
77)  LEE
{normalD}Look, I’m sorry if I scared you. {normalA}I just want to get back to my people. {fearA}Back to Clementine.
78)  VERNON
{sadB}She’s your daughter?
79)  
Yes
80)  
No
81)  LEE
{fearA}Yeah. She’s probably already wondering where I am.
82)  VERNON
{thinkingA}Well we can’t have that, can we?
83)  BRIE
{fearC}Vern, what the hell are you doing?
84)  VERNON
{sadA}It’s all right, Brie. [to Lee] I had a daughter too.{sadB} Lost her in the first days. {disgustA}I’ll be damned if I’ll just sit back and let that happen to someone else.
85)  CLIVE
We need you here!
90)  CLIVE
We need you here!
217)  CLIVE
We need you here!
86)  VERNON
{normalC}Don’t worry. {happyB}I’ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let’s go see about your daughter.
87)  LEE
{sadA}No. She lost her real parents. I’m doing what I can.
88)  BRIE
{fearB}You’re not seriously considering going with him.
215)  BRIE
{fearB}You’re not seriously considering going with him.
89)  VERNON
{sadA}It’s all right, Brie. [to Lee] I had a daughter.{sadB}  Lost her in the first days. {disgustA}I’ll be damned if I’ll just sit back and let that happen to some other little girl.
216)  VERNON
{sadA}It’s all right, Brie. [to Lee] I had a daughter.{sadB}  Lost her in the first days. {disgustA}I’ll be damned if I’ll just sit back and let that happen to some other little girl.
91)  VERNON
{normalC}Don’t worry.{happyB} I’ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let’s go.
218)  VERNON
{normalC}Don’t worry.{happyB} I’ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let’s go.
92)  LEE
{fearA}If you’ve got sick people here, maybe I can help. Our group has medical supplies.
93)  VERNON
{thinkingA}What kind of medical supplies?
94)  LEE
{fearA}I don’t know, all kinds. I’m sure there’s something you could use. {happyA}We’d be happy to trade some for a guide back to where we’re staying.
95)  BOYD
Vern. We need medicine. Joyce is in a lot of pain, I can’t bear to see her like this. Maybe it’s worth the risk.
96)  VERNON
{thinkingA}Maybe so.
100)  VERNON
{thinkingA}Maybe so.
97)  BRIE
{AngryD}Vernon, you can’t trust him.{FearD} He burst into our home and threatened us, and now he just happens to have exactly that we need? {angryD}He’s lying.
101)  BRIE
{AngryD}Vernon, you can’t trust him.{FearD} He burst into our home and threatened us, and now he just happens to have exactly that we need? {angryD}He’s lying.
98)  VERNON
{angryA}Sorry, friend. But Brie’s right.{thinkingA} Maybe if you’d handled yourself different. But as things stand, I can’t help you.
102)  VERNON
{angryA}Sorry, friend. But Brie’s right.{thinkingA} Maybe if you’d handled yourself different. But as things stand, I can’t help you.
99)  LEE
We have a man wounded back where we’re staying. He could use a doctor.
103)  VERNON
How badly wounded? He’s not bitten is he? Because you know...
120)  VERNON
How badly wounded? He’s not bitten is he? Because you know...
104)  LEE
He’s not bitten. He busted his leg when he took a fall. If you’re a doctor, we could sure use your help.
119)  LEE
He’s not bitten. He busted his leg when he took a fall. If you’re a doctor, we could sure use your help.
105)  BRIE
{fearA}You’re not seriously considering going with him.
123)  BRIE
{fearA}You’re not seriously considering going with him.
106)  VERNON
He conducted himself like a gentleman. And I took an oath.
122)  VERNON
He conducted himself like a gentleman. And I took an oath.
107)  BRIE
Vern. Don’t do this. Please. We need you.
124)  BRIE
Vern. Don’t do this. Please. We need you.
108)  VERNON
Don’t worry. I’ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let’s go.
121)  VERNON
Don’t worry. I’ll be back before you know it. [to Lee] Let’s go.
109)  VERNON
No. I’m sorry. Maybe if you hadn’t barged in here and scared the hell out of my people the way you did. But I’ve seen too many like you to risk trusting you.
125)  VERNON
No. I’m sorry. Maybe if you hadn’t barged in here and scared the hell out of my people the way you did. But I’ve seen too many like you to risk trusting you.
110)  VERNON
{happyA}It’s all right, Brie.
111)  LEE
{thinkingA}You can either show me the way back, or die right here. {angryA}What’s it gonna be?
112)  BRIE
[fuming] {angryD}You son of a bitch.
113)  LEE
{angryA}Sorry, but it’s like you said, we’ve all got our own problems.
114)  LEE
[gesturing with his gun, menacing]{normalB}Because this is your other option.
115)  LEE
{normalB}Deal.
116)  VERNON
{happyB}I’ll show you the way back to your people. {angryA}And then I hope I never see you again.
117)  LEE
[gesturing with his gun, menacing]{normalD}I guess this is your only other option, then.
118)  LEE
[pleading]{fearA}No, wait, listen to me.
126)  LEE
{thinkingA}Thanks, I think I can figure out my own way back.
127)  BRIE
{angryB}Where else can he be from? Everywhere else around here is dead.
128)  VERNON
[menacing]{angryB}I think you'd better start talkin'.
129)  LEE
{thinkingA}I came here with a small group hoping to find a boat. {normalD}We just want to get out of here. {thinkingA}How about you just let me go?
130)  VERNON
[pickup]{happyB}[cold, hopeless]Ain't no boats around here. {angryA}Crawford took everything.
131)  LEE
{normalD}Look, I got cornered down here. {sadA}All I want is to get back out to the streets and find my group.
133)  BRIE
See?!
135)  LEE
{thinkingB}Yeah, I heard.
136)  
I'm not from Crawford.
137)  LEE
[calm/negotiating]{thinkingA}I’m not from Crawford, but I saw what they did up there. {disgustB}It made me sick. {normalD}I’m not like them. And I don’t think you are either. {sadA}I think you’re a good man.
138)  
There's a girl who needs me.
141)  LEE
{angryA}Now, tell me. Who the hell are you people?
142)  
Walkers.
143)  
We were looking for a boat.
144)  LEE
I told you...
145)  LEE
{normalD}My group and I were up by the river looking for a boat. Now I just want to just get out of here and find them again.
147)  
That's not important.
148)  LEE
{angryA}That's not important right now. {thinkingA}What's important to me is that I get back to my own people.
151)  VERNON
[pickup] {thinkingA}Unless... {surprisedA}is anyone in your group sick? Or injured?
152)  LEE
[pickup] 	{SadA}Yeah. We got a man hurt pretty bad.
153)  VERNON
{sadB}I took an oath, Brie.
154)  
I'm not from around here.
155)  
We're just looking for a boat.
156)  
I'm just trying to get out of here.
157)  
We can help you, we have medicine. [LIE]
158)  
I have to get back to Clementine.
159)  VERNON
{thinkingA}If you don't want to answer our questions {disgustA}I think it's best you leave.
163)  VERNON
{SadA}You're not going to be able get out of here on your own. But we’ve all got our own problems. {sadB}Two of our group are sick and need constant care. And I’m the only doctor here.

[panicking] {fearC}Vern, what are you doing?
165)  VERNON
[calm/confident] {disgustA}Sorry friend, I'm not buying it.
166)  VERNON
{normalA}I've seen my share of murderers since this all started. Seen too many.  If he was the type to do violence he'd have done it already. [to Lee] {angryA}I'm calling your bluff. Your move.
167)  CLIVE
[pickup] [sounds too much like Fennoy, this is a black guy but it's not Lee, can we get someone else to read this?] We need you here!

[lookat]{thinkingA}This would be enough to keep everyone at the house fed for a while. {normalD}If only I could GET to the house.
175)  LEE
[lookat]{surpriseA}Wonder if someone's living down here.
176)  LEE
[lookat]{thinkingA}If someone IS staying here, I don't wanna be around when they get back.

[pickup] You expect us to help you, after the way you busted in here and terrorized us?
202)  LEE
[pickup] Hey, if I got in your face a little that's too bad. All this shit that's gone down has made us all a little punchy. I just want to get home.
