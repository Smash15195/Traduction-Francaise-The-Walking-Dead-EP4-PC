4)  LEE
[lookat]{happyA}Good chance of a working battery being in that car... {thinkingA}if I can find a way to get up there.

Pry
12)  LEE
[lookat]{sadA}Don't think I can pry that hose apart with just my hands. {thinkingA}Maybe if I had something to cut it with.
13)  MOLLY
I’ll take that. Might come in handy.
14)  LEE

34)  LEE
[pickup][urgent]{fearA}It's still attached to the terminals!
35)  LEE
[pickup][urgent]{fearA}It's still attached to the terminals!
36)  LEE
[urgent]{fearA}The negative terminal's still screwed on!
37)  LEE
[urgent]{fearA}The negative terminal's still screwed on!
38)  LEE
[urgent]{fearA}The positive terminal's still bolted on!
39)  MOLLY
{angryA}Okay, follow me.
40)  MOLLY
{angryB}Move your ass!
41)  MOLLY
{fearB}Put it in here, I’ll carry it!
42)  LEE
{happyA}Got it!
43)  MOLLY
{fearC}Yeah, but we still got a problem here.
44)  LEE

54)  LEE
I don’t know, man...
55)  MOLLY
Oh, brother. Hold on.
56)  MOLLY
Think you can handle that?
57)  MOLLY
[out of breath] You really are a pussy, aren’t you?
58)  
Open
60)  LEE
{thinkingA}Maybe there's a car battery in there we can use for the boat.
61)  MOLLY
[sarcastic]{disgustA}Perfect.
62)  LEE
{thinkingB}Well I can see where the battery SHOULD be. {angryA}But it's not.
63)  LEE
{angryA}Looks like Crawford already used this battery for something else.
