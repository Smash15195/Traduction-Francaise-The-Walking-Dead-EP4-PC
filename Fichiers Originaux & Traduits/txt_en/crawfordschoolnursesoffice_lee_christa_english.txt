4)  
About Clementine...
5)  
Are you feeling okay?
6)  
I'd better go
7)  
Wait
8)  LEE
{normalD}Okay.
9)  CHRISTA
{sadA}Look Lee, I just wanna get back to Omid. Let me do my thing, alright?
10)  LEE
{normalD}Christa--
11)  CHRISTA
[pickup2]{angryB}I'm busy, Lee. Just let me work.
12)  CHRISTA
[frustrated] {angryA}No! {worriedA}Without the combination I don't know how we're going to get this damn thing open. [fearful] If we don't get back to Omid with some medicine soon...
13)  LEE
{sadA}It's okay. We'll figure it out.
14)  LEE
{fearA}You're right. I'm sorry.
26)  LEE
{fearA}You're right. I'm sorry.
15)  CHRISTA
[insistent] {SadA}That is not going to happen. {angryA}Do you hear me? {angryB}That is NOT going to happen. {angryC}We're going to get these meds to Omid and he's going to be fine. [upset] He's going to be FINE!
27)  CHRISTA
[insistent] {SadA}That is not going to happen. {angryA}Do you hear me? {angryB}That is NOT going to happen. {angryC}We're going to get these meds to Omid and he's going to be fine. [upset] He's going to be FINE!
16)  LEE
{normalD}Because leaving her alone with Omid didn't seem any safer.
17)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Then why did you?
18)  CHRISTA
[accusatory] {angryA}What's THAT supposed to mean?
19)  LEE
{SadA}No offense, Christa, but Omid's pretty sick. {fearA}If he were to die, with Clementine alone in the house with him...
20)  LEE
{thinkingA}I hope I did the right thing bringing Clementine with us. {fearA}This place isn't exactly safe.
21)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}Why shouldn't she be?
22)  LEE
{SadA}I know, I know. I just want her to be safe.
23)  LEE
{sadA}I hope I did the right thing leaving Clementine back at the house.
24)  CHRISTA
{thinkingA}What else were you going to do? Bring her on a dangerous mission?
25)  LEE
{sadA}No offense, Christa, but Omid's pretty sick.{fearA} If he dies, with Clementine alone in the house with him...
28)  CHRISTA
{angryC}Oh come on, you'd just dug up a rotting dog carcass! {angryB}I'm surprised we weren't ALL throwing up. {sadA}Lee, I'm fine. {SadB}Quit worrying about me, okay? Worry about Omid, we've got to get him these meds!
29)  LEE
{fearA}It's just that you've been looking a little pale the past couple of days. You've been throwing up...
30)  LEE
{fearA}Are you feeling okay?
31)  CHRISTA
{angryA}I'm fine. Why are you asking me that?
32)  CHRISTA
{angryA}Yeah, same here.
33)  LEE
{SadA}I've got things to do.
34)  CHRISTA
{angryA}No offense, but I'm a little busy trying to get this safe open. {sadA}Omid needs that medicine.
35)  LEE
{thinkingA}Are you making any progress with the safe?
