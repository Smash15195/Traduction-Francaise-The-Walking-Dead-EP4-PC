1)  LEE
How's it coming?
2)  VERNON
Not well. Did you get that battery yet?
3)  LEE
We did, but Molly took off with it. She said she'd be back, but I don't know what's going on with her.
4)  LEE
Workin' on it.
5)  LEE
{normalD}Hey Vernon?
6)  LEE
{normalD}How's it coming?
7)  VERNON
{thinkingA}Slow. Too slow. I'm worried that by the time we manage to get this thing open, it may be too late.
8)  LEE
{happyA}I'll go see if I can find something that'll help us get that safe open.
9)  VERNON
{thinkingA}Look, we don't have time to just sit around. We need to get this safe open.
10)  
Bye.
11)  LEE
{happyA}Molly helped me get the battery we needed.
12)  VERNON
{thinkingA}Took off... with the battery?
13)  VERNON
{happyA}That's great, one down. Where is she?
14)  VERNON
{thinkingA}I hope so. That girl doesn't really strike me as a team player. More the mercenary kind.
15)  LEE
{thinkingA}She took off, had some kind of errand she needed to run.
16)  LEE
{normalD}Yeah. Don't worry, {thinkingA}she'll be back.
17)  LEE
{fearA}How much time do you think Omid has, doc?
18)  VERNON
{sadB}You want my medical opinion? {thinkingA}The sooner we get him some strong antibiotics to start fighting that infection, the better. Let's just leave it at that.
19)  LEE
{happyA}Hey doc, I just wanted to thank you for coming with us, and for all your help. I really appreciate it.
24)  LEE
{happyA}Hey doc, I just wanted to thank you for coming with us, and for all your help. I really appreciate it.
20)  VERNON
[grumpily] {angryA}Don't thank me. I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for my people. {thinkingA}They need this medicine as badly as your friend does.
21)  LEE
Hey doc, I just wanted to thank you for coming with us, and for all your help. I really appreciate it.
22)  VERNON
{happyB}Don't mention it. It's times like these we've got to help each other the most, right? {angryA}Or we're no better than those Crawford sons-of-bitches.
23)  LEE
{happyA}I heard that.
25)  VERNON
{happyA}Good idea.
26)  
About Molly...
27)  
About Omid...
28)  
Thank you for coming with us.
