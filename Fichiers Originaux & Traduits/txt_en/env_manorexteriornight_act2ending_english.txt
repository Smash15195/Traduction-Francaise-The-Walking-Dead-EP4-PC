[counting] {ThinkingB} Me, you, Clem, Christa, Omid, Ben, Molly...
10)  KENNY
{AngryA} So we’re gonna have a capacity problem. {ThinkingA} Boat that size ain’t gonna hold more than five people, even with one of them a kid.
11)  KENNY
{NormalC} Assuming everyone makes it back alive, that’s still one too many, even if we cut Molly loose. {ThinkingA} Before this is over we’re gonna have to make a decision.
12)  MOLLY
{NormalA} Then what are we waiting for? Let’s get moving.

29)  CLEMENTINE
{FearB} I remember.
30)  LEE
{NormalB} You remember how to use it, don’t you? {HappyA} It’s just like I showed you.
31)  LEE
So if anyone tries to get inside the house that isn’t one of us...{NormalD}  or if something does happen to Omid...
32)  CLEMENTINE
[grim]{AngryA}  I know what to do.
33)  LEE
Hey. Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be okay.
40)  LEE
Hey. Don’t worry. Everything’s going to be okay.
34)  LEE
Let’s get you inside.
35)  LEE
[resolute] Let’s get this over with.
36)  LEE

37)  LEE
Good girl.
38)  LEE
{Body-F}{NormalD} If that happens - if you see or hear anyone outside trying to get in, {NormalC} I want you to find a place to hide and stay there. {NormalD} And don’t come out until I get back.{ThinkingA}  Do you understand?

{Body-F} {ThinkingA} I'm not leaving her alone in this house with only Omid to protect her. {NormalC} Just not happening.
47)  VERNON
{AngryA} Did you not hear anything I said about the kind of place Crawford is? {ThinkingA} If you take her in there and they find her-
48)  LEE
{Body-F} {ThinkingA} This isn’t up for a debate, Vernon. {NormalC} Decision’s made.
49)  MOLLY
{NormalA} For what it’s worth, {ThinkingA} I don’t think it’s a great idea either.
73)  MOLLY
{NormalA} For what it’s worth, {ThinkingA} I don’t think it’s a great idea either.
50)  LEE
{Body-F} This little girl's not just excess baggage. She's gotten us out of a tight spot more than once.
51)  KENNY
{NormalC} You heard the man. Let’s move out.

How?
53)  
The more the better.

76)  KENNY
{NormalC} So we're going to have a {NormalB} capacity problem. Assuming everyone makes it back alive, {NormalC}there ain't gonna be room for everyone.
77)  LEE
{ThinkingB} What are you trying to say?
78)  KENNY
{NormalB} Just giving you a heads-up, is all. {NormalC} Thought you oughta know.
79)  LEE
{NormalB} Good, we're gonna need all the help we can get.
81)  LEE
We don't need her. She's just going to slow us down.
86)  CLEMENTINE
[determined]{NormalC} I can help. I've been helpful lots of times before.
