1)  MOLLY
[guilty/self-conscious] Oh hey. You made it back.
2)  LEE
[calling out] Clementine? Clem?
3)  VERNON
[suspicious/wary] Who’s this?
4)  LEE
Molly?
5)  MOLLY
He didn’t tell you about me? Understandable, I guess. I’m the one who put that beating on him when he tried to jump me back at the river. [to Lee] Who’s the fossil?
6)  MOLLY
He didn’t tell you about me? I’m the one who saved his ass back at the river. [to Lee] Who’s the fossil?
7)  MOLLY
She’s around here somewhere. Relax, I got her and Kenny both back safely. You’re welcome, by the way.
8)  LEE
Where’s Clementine?
86)  LEE
Where’s Clementine?
137)  
Where’s Clementine?
9)  LEE
This is Vernon, he’s a doctor, he helped me get back here after we got separated.
10)  VERNON
[bitter]Not by choice, I can assure you.
11)  LEE
What were you doing?
139)  
What were you doing?
12)  MOLLY
Just looking. Figured you might have something you’d want to donate as a thank-you for getting your friends back safely.
13)  VERNON
{disgustA}[offended] Fossil?!
14)  VERNON
{disgustA}[offended] Fossil?!
15)  CHRISTA
[pickup][frantic, very worried]Lee. Thank God you're back.
16)  CHRISTA
{worrieda}[frantic]It’s Omid. He’s gotten worse. Much worse.
17)  LEE
Christa, what’s wrong?
18)  VERNON
Is that the wounded man you told me about?
19)  LEE
Yeah.
20)  CHRISTA
{fearb}Oh thank God!
141)  CHRISTA
{fearb}Oh thank God!
21)  CHRISTA
{worrieda}Who’s this?
142)  CHRISTA
{worrieda}Who’s this?
22)  LEE
This is Vernon, he’s a doctor.
140)  LEE
This is Vernon, he’s a doctor.
23)  LEE
[to Vernon] Could you take a look at him?
24)  LEE
[to Vernon] We have a man wounded.
25)  VERNON
[to Lee] [urgency]I’ll need to see those medical supplies.
26)  CHRISTA
[puzzled] {feara}What medical supplies?
27)  VERNON
[sarcastic/skeptical] Well, you just get better and better, don’t you?
28)  LEE
[caught in a lie] Sorry, doc. Had to get you on board somehow.
29)  VERNON
[urgency]I’ll see what I can do. Take me to him.
30)  CHRISTA
[urgency]{worrieda}You have to help us... please?
31)  VERNON
[pickup] [urgency]I work better without an audience. Why don’t you go find your little girl?
32)  VERNON
[urgency]I work better without an audience. Why don’t you go find Clementine?
33)  LEE
[to himself] Clementine... [calling out] Clementine?
34)  KENNY
Found it.
35)  KENNY
What does it look like?
36)  KENNY
[half-drunk] Oh hey. You made it back. Good job. Good job.
37)  LEE
Where’d you get the bottle?
38)  LEE
Kenny?
39)  LEE
Hey, take it easy. I think you’ve had enough.
40)  LEE
What the hell do you think you’re doing?
41)  KENNY
To hell with you!
125)  KENNY
To hell with you!
42)  LEE
Getting wasted’s not going to help anyone.
43)  LEE
Kenny! Give me the damn bottle!
44)  KENNY
Yeah, well, what is? We are fucked!
45)  LEE
[to Ben/accusatory] The fuck were you thinking, letting Kenny get like this?
54)  LEE
[to Ben/accusatory] The fuck were you thinking, letting Kenny get like this?
46)  KENNY
[bitter] You want to help? Ha! Where were you up in that attic? You didn’t do shit for me then, I don’t need you to do shit for me now!
62)  KENNY
[bitter] You want to help? Ha! Where were you up in that attic? You didn’t do shit for me then, I don’t need you to do shit for me now!
47)  KENNY
[still fuming/drunk] This is the only fucking thing I have left, you want to take that from me too? Well fuck you!
48)  KENNY
We’re all fucked anyway. Molly said there’s not a single boat left in Savannah. No way out. If we’re gonna die, at least we can die with our load on.
49)  BEN
Whoa, whoa! Simmer down, guys. It’s cool.
50)  LEE
Kenny, give me the damn bottle!
60)  LEE
Kenny, give me the damn bottle!
51)  BEN
Hey man, I tried, but he gave me a look like he was gonna rip my face off. He won’t listen to you, you think he was gonna listen to me?
52)  KENNY
Get the fuck away from me!
55)  KENNY
Get the fuck away from me!
124)  KENNY
Get the fuck away from me!
53)  LEE
I’m just trying to help, man. Getting wasted’s not going to help anyone.
57)  LEE
I’m just trying to help, man. Getting wasted’s not going to help anyone.
56)  BEN
{feara}Hey man, I tried, but he gave me a look like he was gonna rip my face off. {thinkinga}He won’t listen to you, you think he was gonna listen to me?
58)  BEN
{fearA}Whoa, whoa! {sadA}Simmer down, guys. It’s cool.
59)  KENNY
[still fuming/drunk] This is the only fucking thing I got left, you want to take that from me too? Well fuck you!
61)  KENNY
We’re all fucked anyway.
64)  LEE
Have either of you seen Clementine?
65)  KENNY
Damned if I know. Gotta be around here somewhere.
66)  BEN
[pickup][sighs]Whatever.
134)  BEN
[pickup][sighs]Whatever.
67)  LEE
[pickup] {angrya}[firm]Don't give me that 'whatever' shit. Just tell me where she is NOW.
133)  LEE
[pickup] {angrya}[firm]Don't give me that 'whatever' shit. Just tell me where she is NOW.
68)  BEN
{sada}I’m sorry, man. When Omid took a turn for the worse, Christa asked me to come help.
69)  LEE
{angrya}That’s not good enough.
70)  LEE
{angrya}Ben, I gave you one job when I left here - take care of Clementine. Then she shows up out on River Street looking for me? What the hell happened?
71)  BEN
I think she’s with that girl who brought her back, Molly. She said something about checking out the attic to look for supplies.
72)  LEE
[legitimately pissed]YOU checked it? [under his breath]Oh, great...
73)  BEN
I think she went out to play in the backyard.
74)  BEN
She’s fine! The yard’s secure, I checked it myself.
75)  LEE
[horrified] On her own? With no-one watching her?
76)  CHRISTA
[pickup2]We’re fine. Just... leave us alone and let the doctor work.
77)  LEE
{normalb}Everything okay in there?
78)  
Knock
79)  LEE
{normalc}[to himself, worried]No, I need to find Clementine.
81)  LEE
[calling up the the attic] Molly, you there?
82)  LEE
{thinkinga}What are you doing?
83)  MOLLY
{normalA}Oh, you know. Just poking around.
84)  LEE
{normalc}You won't find anything, we already searched the place.
85)  MOLLY
{normalb}You’d be surprised what people miss. Trust me, I’ve been doing this a while.
87)  MOLLY
Don’t ask me, I’m not her keeper.
88)  LEE
{normalc}The guys downstairs said she was up here with you.
89)  MOLLY
{normala}She was for a while, then she got bored and wandered off. {angrya}Like I said, not her keeper.
90)  LEE
{angrya}[very stern] Hey! Do I look like I’m in the mood to be jerked around? Where did she go?
93)  LEE
{angrya}[very stern] Hey! Do I look like I’m in the mood to be jerked around? Where did she go?
91)  MOLLY
{thinkinga}[sighs, remembering] I think she said something about going to play in the back yard.
92)  LEE
{feara}[worried] Shit...
94)  MOLLY
{thinkinga}[sighs, remembering] Last I saw, she was downstairs with your redneck friend and that college kid who hangs around with him. Why don’t you go bug them?
95)  MOLLY
[callng back down, busy]I told you, that girl isn't with me. Go ask your buddies and quit bothering me!
101)  MOLLY
[callng back down, busy]I told you, that girl isn't with me. Go ask your buddies and quit bothering me!

99)  LEE
[calling up]
104)  LEE
{angryb}[pissed]How could you just leave her in the backyard?
105)  KENNY
{drunkA}[slightly drunk, defeated]Like it matters. We're all fucked, Lee.
106)  LEE
{thinkinga}You sure Clementine's up there in the attic with Molly?
107)  BEN
{thinkingA}Uh, I think so. {normalA}Yeah, pretty sure.
108)  LEE
{normalc}[getting worried, impatient]Look, I just talked to Molly and Clementine's not up there.
109)  BEN
{thinkinga}Oh, well, maybe she's in the backyard, then?
110)  DIR
It might be nice here if Kenny or Ben could summarize the danger. (Walkers, the voice on the radio, zombies.)
111)  LEE
{angrya}[irritated]Thanks.
112)  LEE

129)  BEN
{feara}She was frantic and things got kind of crazy. I told Clementine to stay put, what else could I do?
130)  
That's not good enough.
131)  
It's okay.
132)  
Where IS she?!
135)  LEE
{angrya} Ben, how did Clementine sneak out of the house?
136)  BEN
Don't be mad at me, Lee.
138)  
He’s a doctor.
143)  LEE
Kenny, come on. Gimme that.
144)  KENNY
Molly said there’s not a single boat left in Savannah. No way out.  We got walkers all around us, that crazy fuck on the radio messing with us... hell, if now ain't the time for a drink...
