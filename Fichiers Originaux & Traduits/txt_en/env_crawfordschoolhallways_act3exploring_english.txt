1)  MOLLY
Took you long enough.
2)  MOLLY
Ready yet?
3)  
Let’s go.
7)  LEE
Let’s go.
4)  
Not yet.
5)  LEE
Not just yet. I want to look around a little more first.
6)  MOLLY
[sarcastic] Great. Take your time. It’s not like we’re on the clock here or anything.
8)  LEE
Ready when you are.
9)  MOLLY
Okay, once we go through the door the auto shop should be at the end of the alley, on the far side of the street. Let’s try to not do too much sightseeing on the way, okay? We get over there, we find that battery and we haul ass straight back here.
10)  MOLLY
On three. One... two... THREE!
11)  MOLLY
Later. Something I gotta do first.
12)  LEE
{angryA} Come on.
13)  MOLLY
Yeah, I think I’ll hold onto it, make sure you don’t leave without me. See you back in class!
14)  MOLLY
Catch you later.
15)  LEE
[stunned] What?
16)  LEE
Wait! You’ve still got the battery!
17)  LEE
Goddammit! What the hell is she doing?
18)  LEE
Molly!
19)  LEE
You guys need any help?
20)  VERNON
Thanks, but I think we’re almost in.
21)  CHRISTA
Don’t you have your own job to do? We still need that battery. Go on, we’ve got this.
22)  LEE
Right.
23)  LEE
You sure you two don't need any help?
24)  CHRISTA
We're taking care of it, Lee. Don't worry.
265)  CHRISTA
We're taking care of it, Lee. Don't worry.
25)  LEE
[under his breath] Shit.
26)  LEE
[under his breath, to himself] Christa and Vernon must be trapped in there.
27)  CHRISTA
[muffled, from inside] Lee??
28)  LEE
Christa? Vernon? You guys in there?
29)  VERNON
[muffled, from inside] Oh thank God!
30)  VERNON
Get inside, quick!
31)  MOLLY
Sightseeing.
32)  LEE
What’s that?
33)  LEE
Jesus Christ. You scared the shit out of me. Where the fuck have you been?
34)  MOLLY
[stunned/denying] What? Who told you that?
183)  MOLLY
[stunned/denying] What? Who told you that?
35)  LEE
You can quit with the act, Molly. I know you’re from Crawford.
36)  LEE
I saw you on a security tape. Why’d you lie to me?
37)  MOLLY
Nothing.
60)  MOLLY
Nothing.
63)  MOLLY
Nothing.
38)  MOLLY
Hey, from what I’ve heard you’re not real big on the truth yourself. Besides, I didn’t lie.
47)  MOLLY
Hey, from what I’ve heard you’re not real big on the truth yourself. Besides, I didn’t lie.
39)  LEE
I asked you how you knew about Crawford, you said you’d just heard stories.
40)  MOLLY
I said there were stories about Crawford, I never said that’s how I knew about it. I never lied to you. And even if I did, so what? I don’t owe you anything.
41)  LEE
Who’s the picture of, Molly? Is that your sister? Is that what you went looking for?
42)  MOLLY
[caught off-guard/defensive] Fuck you. I don’t even know you.
43)  LEE
You saved my life twice, but you can’t tell me the truth?
44)  MOLLY
[defenses breaking down] Are we really going to do this now?
45)  LEE
I guess that’s up to you.
46)  MOLLY
I didn’t lie.
48)  MOLLY
[increasingly emotional] I used to live here with my sister. She was fourteen years old. When the dead started walking and Crawford shut itself in, it seemed like a pretty good deal at first. We were safe, we had everything we needed to survive.
49)  MOLLY
[emotional] Then the rules started coming down. No-one who couldn’t justify their place, earn their keep. No-one who required special care. My sister was diabetic, and by Crawford’s rules that made her a liability.
50)  MOLLY
[emotional] I kept it a secret, kept her safe for as long as I could. But in the end, I couldn’t protect her. [starting to cry] That’s when I got out. Crawford, they always talked about how their system worked, how anything was better than becoming “one of them.” But I saw what they’d already become. I just wish I could have seen it before it was too late. Before they came and took my sister away.
51)  MOLLY
[emotional] I should have taken her out of here long before, we could have made it on the outside. I could have protected her better. I should have protected her better.
52)  LEE
What was her name?
53)  MOLLY
[still tearful/upset] This is all I have left of her.
54)  MOLLY
I didn’t have time to take it before I got out of Crawford. [defensive/upset] I just wanted it, okay?
55)  LEE
It’s okay, Molly. I understand. She’s pretty.
56)  MOLLY
You would have liked her.
57)  LEE
If she was anything like you, I’m sure I would have.
58)  MOLLY
What the hell...?
64)  MOLLY
What the hell...?
59)  LEE
I think that’s our cue to get the hell out of here.
65)  LEE
I think that’s our cue to get the hell out of here.
61)  LEE
[suspicious] Sure there’s nothing you want to tell me?
62)  MOLLY
[hard] Yeah, I’m sure. Are we done?
66)  MOLLY
[struggling] Lee! Shoot this fucker!
67)  LEE
[impending dread] Oh no...
68)  MOLLY
[to Lee and Ben] Go! Run!
69)  LEE
[startled] Shit! Ben!
70)  BEN
[spooked] Aaaaah!
71)  LEE
Shit!
72)  BEN
I just found it, it was stuck in a door handle at the end of the hallway back there.
73)  BEN
No, Kenny’s with her. We still can’t open that armory door, he sent me out to look for something we can use to bust it open. I found this.
74)  LEE
Uh, Ben... where did you get that?
75)  LEE
[startled] Did you leave Clementine alone?
76)  BEN
Kenny and I still can't get the door open to the armory. He sent me out to look for something we can use to bust it open. I found this.

Nice shot.
78)  LEE
Thank me later, come on!
79)  LEE
Ben, we gotta go. Ben!
80)  LEE
Move your ass!
81)  MOLLY
Thanks.
82)  LEE
It wasn’t me...
83)  LEE
Clementine!
84)  MOLLY
[impressed] Good going, kid. Nice shot.
85)  CLEMENTINE
[still a bit shocked] Thanks...
86)  CHRISTA
[shouting] Come on!
87)  CHRISTA
[shouting] Come on!
88)  CHRISTA
[shouting] Come on!
89)  MOLLY
[agony/shrieking] Aaaaaaargh!
90)  KENNY
Little help here?
91)  LEE
[to himself] [lookat]This must be the way to the playground where Brie said the fuel was being stored.
125)  LEE
[to himself] [lookat]This must be the way to the playground where Brie said the fuel was being stored.

128)  LEE
[to himself] [lookat]Hasn't been much time yet. I'd better let Brie and Kenny do their thing.

105)  KENNY
Let’s not start high-fiving each other just yet. Let’s get the hell back to the classroom. Give us a hand with these fuel cans, they weigh a goddamn ton.

[to himself][lookat]Alley's overrun. Guess I'm not going back out there again.
117)  LEE
Not working. Of course.
118)  LEE
[to himself]Think it's empty. Those Crawford people probably locked this stuff up somewhere.
119)  LEE
[to himself]Not going back to the sewer until we get what we came here for.
123)  LEE
[to himself]They've already been fired. They're worthless.

Let's just go.
148)

149)  BEN
Sorry, sorry! I just got spooked by those bells. And then I heard someone coming...
150)  
What are you doing?!
151)  MOLLY
[startled] Jesus!
152)  LEE
What the fuck are you doing out here?
155)  
It's okay, Ben.
159)  
It's okay, Ben.
157)  LEE
[recovering from shock] We're okay. Did you get that door open in the classroom?
158)  BEN
Not yet. Kenny sent me out to look for something we can use to bust it open. I found this.
160)  MOLLY
[recovering from shock] What the hell were you doing out here, anyway?
163)  MOLLY
[recovering from shock] What the hell were you doing out here, anyway?
164)  MOLLY
[calling out]The alleyway to the auto shop's down here. You coming or not?
165)  LEE
[calling out]Hello?
166)  LEE
[to himself]This is definitely the door to the auto shop. But where's Molly?
167)  
Where's Clementine?
168)  
Did you get that door open?
169)  MOLLY
[sucking it up] Yeah, well... who doesn't, these days?
170)  LEE
I don't care about your life story, Molly.
171)  LEE
I'm sorry for what happened to your sister. But right now I just want to get the job done and get back to the house.
172)  LEE
It's just that me and my people, we've got our own problems, you know?
173)  MOLLY
Then maybe you shouldn't have asked.
174)  MOLLY
Hey. You asked.
175)  MOLLY
All right. Let's party.
176)  LEE
[pickup][lookat]Seems Crawford used some of these rooms to quarantine walkers. Better not mess with them.
177)  LEE
Shell casings all over. Whatever happened here, it wasn't good.
238)  LEE
Shell casings all over. Whatever happened here, it wasn't good.
178)  LEE
[to himself][lookat]This place definitely has some major damage.
179)  LEE

180)  MOLLY
What?
181)  LEE
You said you'd never been here before. But that wasn't the truth, was it?
182)  LEE
[accusatory]You lied to me.
184)  LEE
I saw you on a security tape. You were having an affair with that doctor.
185)  LEE
Forget it. We got what we came here for. Let's just go.
186)  MOLLY
Well okay. Let's--

No, this is good.

Oh man, we are screwed, we are so screwed...
207)  
How is this good?
208)  VERNON
Before, everyone in Crawford was smart and they had guns. Now they’re dumb and they don’t. Hey, trying to look on the bright side here.

He's right.
211)  LEE
Vernon's right. We can deal with walkers easier than armed guards.
212)  
We should leave. Now.
214)  VERNON
No, listen to me.
215)  LEE
It's all over. We should leave this place. Now.

[nervous]Did he just say this is a good thing?
218)  VERNON
Look at it this way...
219)  MOLLY
Just keep moving.
220)  BEN
The plan hasn’t changed? Every time walkers show up the plan changes! Do you even have any idea how many of them are out there?
221)  BEN
I got a bad feeling about this.
222)  BRIE
Come on, I think I know which way to head.
223)  CHRISTA
No. You wanna do a headcount? Or do you want to get what we need and get the hell out of here?
224)  KENNY
I agree. So long as we don’t let ‘em box us in, we can still do this. The plan hasn’t changed.
225)  BRIE
Here.
226)  LEE
Looks okay. Everybody in.
227)  
I don't think so.
